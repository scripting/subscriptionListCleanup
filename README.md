# subscriptionListCleanup

Read an OPML subscription list, and loop over all the feeds and only pass on the ones that are reachable and parseable.

#### More info

Sorry there are no docs at this time. 

I did write a <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/05/18.html#a151929">blog post</a> about it. :smile:

If you have questions, post in this <a href="https://github.com/scripting/subscriptionListCleanup/issues/1">issue thread</a>.
